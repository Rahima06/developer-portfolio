            <p>A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn
                before the rest of the world. The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up. A dream you
                dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.</p>

                <p>The three main types of developers are front-end developers, back-end developers, and full-stack
                    developers. However, there are also more specialized programming and development roles, like the
                    ones we
                    mentioned above, which means we can break down the number of developers into even more categories.
